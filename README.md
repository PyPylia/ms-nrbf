# ms-nrbf
An implementation of the MS-NRBF protocol in Rust

### Warning: This library is very much still in alpha, please do not use it in production until the 1.0.0 release. Many parts of the MS-NRBF spec are still not implemented. For this reason I will not release any documentation until I am satisified that it is stable.
